# count-down-timer
Count down timer with optional to-do list tied to an event
Using printf() and scanf() functions display and accept input from the user for a initial date determined by the user
Validate the first date by determining if the year is between two defined dates called max_yr and min_year, determine if the month is between 1 and 12 and the day between 1 and 31
using printf() and scanf() functions display and accept input from the user for an event date (sometime in the future) as determined by the user
Validate the second date using the same parameters as the first.
determine the difference between the two dates by first determining if the date (day) of the event is less than the day for the begiginning or first date.
Determine leap year status for event year
if the event day is smaller than the initial day date then simple subtraction can be used to determine the days difference.
if the event month is smaller than the initial month date then simple substraction can be used to determine the month difference.
calculate the distance in years, months, and days.
prompt user how many to-do list items to enter using the scanf() and scanf() functions.
using a loop display "Enter to do list task" as many times as needed (per the user input in previous step).
